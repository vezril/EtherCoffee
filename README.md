EtherCoffee was my final project of my DEC at Dawson College of Electronics Technologies. It was a project of love for coffee, and an offering to my favourite teacher of all time.

This project is as is, there will be no further contributions. I just want it immortalized on my profile. The code is shitty, but it was what I could pull off at the time. I'm now a much better software engineer than I was.

Pictured above is what's called the MinSys, or Mini System. We had scratched built a microcontroller in the previous semester leading up to this project, a microcontroller around the Intel 8088 microcontroller. All the firmware was written in x86 assembly. It boasted a whopping 32k 8-bit SRAM, and an astounding 8k 8-bit ROM. Boy all the assembly you can shove in that!

Anyways, enjoy.
